  # code-quiz

  This is a project to test our HTML/CSS/JS/WebAPI abilities. The goal is to build a website that tests the users knowledge of web development principles. It is a timed quiz that records the users highest scores based on how many they got right and how fast they completed the quiz.

  ## Usage
  
  The game works when the user clicks start they are prompted with 5 random questions about coding! This is timed to see how well you can do, every wrong answer subtracts 10 from your time. The highest score wins! The highest scores are recorded on a high score page in which you can clear when you're tired of seeing someone else win.
